# Travel Tales

A webisite that allows the user to manage all their travel plans and recommendations in one place.


## Description

Planning a big trip can quickly get overwhelming with so many places to see and things to do. And then there’s that moment at a party when someone recommends an amazing little restaurant in a hidden village—you swear you’ll remember it, but it ends up lost on a crumpled receipt or the back of your hand.

This travel planner helps you ditch the scattered notes and keeps everything in one place.

Create a personal profile and build your trip by gathering all your plans—where to eat, what to visit, activities to try, and fun facts you don’t want to forget
